Problem: Tensile strength test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rubber company wants to minimize the cost of testing produces. Such that they provide only 3 samples
for the test for each production model. All samples are identical. The test is straightforward, one sample is put
to the force testing machine which yields the result as either torn or nothing. The sample which has been torn apart
cannot be reused for testing and the test will be stopped when out of samples. The sample will be torn if the applied
force exceeds the certain point and it will save the point and below.

Suppose the range of force that is applied for testing id 1-1000 (integer). Your job is to find the least number
of trials which would guarantee that the company finds the right certain point when the sample starts to be torn.
